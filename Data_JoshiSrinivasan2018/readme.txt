This compressed folder contains all raw data (about 1 GB) used to generate the results in this article in the following directory structure. 

- Specifically, we have a separate folder for each type of perturbation (1) fore-aft versus (2) sideways or left-right perturbations).

- Each such perturbation-specific folder has sub-folders corresponding to each subject that performed the trials.

- Each such subject-specific folder has files with data from the walking trials with unforeseen perturbations. 

- The individual data files have names like Subject1Trial5.csv, corresponding to Subject 1's 5th walking trial, etc. 

- The data are in a 'comma separated value' format (csv), with each column of values corresponding to a pelvis or foot marker. The marker identity for each marker is provided in the header of the csv file. We have thirteen markers overall, five on the pelvis, and four on each foot. Each marker has X, Y, Z coordinates, so we have 45 columns corresponding to the markers, plus the initial column for time. The motion capture data was recorded at 100 Hz using a Vicon T20 system. 

- The file subjectAnthpometry.txt contains age, mass, leg length, and treadmill velocity for all the subjects.
